          I'm Clark, a BSIT student who is learning about web designing for the first time.
          I did not expect to somewhat enjoy web designing even though I thought that I won't be needing to learn it or know about it since it doesn't align with my specialization, but after learning and being able to create my own website I learned how to appreciate it.
          Outside tech, I’m into basketball, building model kits, and weight lifting.
